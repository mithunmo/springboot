					<b>At Fashion For Globe we work within a credit system:</b>
					<br />
					<p>
						<b>What does that mean?</b>
						<br />
						<i>Think of FFG credits as Fashion For Globe's very own currency. Credits are our way of simplifying the process of pricing your work.</i>
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>What is the FFG credit to dollar conversion?</b>
						<br />
						<i>1 FFG credit = $25 USD. </i>
						<br />
						<br />
						<i>Keep in mind that FFG credits are in whole number units. Be sure not to include decimal points or other characters in your total board price. When you enter a FFG credit amount, our calculator will automatically tell you how much you will be earning for this board in USD. </i>
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Does FFG take a commission off of that amount?</b>
						<br />
						<i>No, this is the dollar amount that will be automatically deposited into your account if your design is purchased. </i>
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>How many credits should I charge for each board?</b>
						<br />
						<i>We recommend pricing your boards based on how many looks are included. A look is defined as the coordinated items on a single model/croquis. This can be one dress, a top and bottom, or as many pieces as it takes to sell the concept and designs on one outfit.</i>
						<br />
						<br />
						<i>Example: If your design board contains 6 individual looks, we recommend pricing your board between $300-$900. If you are selling a board with only 1 garment design we would recommend selling it for $50-$150 depending on the complexity of the design.</i>
						<br />
						<br />
						<i style="text-decoration: underline;">Fashion For Globe does not limit you to a specific price per board but we generally recommend pricing each look between 2 to 6 credits which is the equivalent of $50-$150.</i>
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>What if I'm a textile designer? How does pricing work?</b>
						<br />
						<i>You can price your work based on the same set of standards mentioned above. Consider each print design as a look and calculate your board price accordingly. </i>
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Will the Fashion For Globe team help me price my work?</b>
						<br />
						<i>Absolutely, one of the reasons that we have a review process for every board you upload to the site is to give us a chance to help you correctly price and categorize your work. If we feel you could be charging more based on your skill level, quality of designs or demand for a current product or trend we will reach out and give you the option to edit your board price. If we know that buyers are currently only purchasing within a specific price range we may also recommend lowering your current listing prices in order to gain some exposure. Fashion For Globe is here only to make suggestions; ultimately, the decision is yours on how to price your work.</i>
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Other tips: </b>
						<br />
						<i>Take into consideration your usual hourly rate, experience level, quality as well as technical specifications included within the full design package when pricing your work.</i>
						<br />
						<br />
						<i>If your current freelance rate is $15/hr keep your per look cost between $50-75.</i>
						<br />
						<br />
						<i>If you currently charge $40-50/hr keep your per look cost within $100-$150.</i>
